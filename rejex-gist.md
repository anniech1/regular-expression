# Regex

Regular expressions, or regex, are a series of characters which act as key to help us search text blocks for a matching pattern. They helps us effectivly search for phone numbers, emails, addresses, tracking ids, or any other pattern-base set of characters in large swaths of text.

## Summary

For this gist I will be looking at the regex for searching HEX codes, which are used in identifying and displaying colors. The regex for HEX values is:
``` 
/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/.
``` 
I will be explaining what the literal and meta characters in this regex represent and what their usages are when a user is searching for HEX codes.
